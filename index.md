I am an **Engineering Manager** at Reddit. I manage the team responsible for building the revenue critical streaming and batch processing pipelines that enable Ad-serving, billing, analytics & ML operations. Additionally, my team also builds and oversees the operation of event storage systems, compliance to data retention policies and the reporting infrastructure. 
Earlier I lead work in Ads-Targeting: building features to match advertisers with their right audiences and in Data Engineering: building data ingestion & warehousing flow, growing pipeline 30X to 20 billion raw events/day.

I worked as a Research Engineer at [Lithium Technologies and Klout](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/27/lithium-acquires-klout/) between 2012 and 2017.
I graduated from the [University of California, Davis](htttp://ucdavis.edu) with a **PhD in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/)** in 2012. I was advised by [Prof. S. (Shyhtsun) Felix Wu](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~wu/). My research area was software systems built on social networks to power search engines.

I dabbled in economic data analysis and worked with World International Patent Organization (WIPO) through [Prof. Travis Lybbert](http://tlybbert.ucdavis.edu/), UC Davis to develop software systems based on text processing and keyword extraction models to analyze trademark and economic data.

Details of my professional experiences are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prantikbhattacharyya/).
